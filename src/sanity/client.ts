/**
 * Fetches CMS content through the server-side proxy at /api/content.
 *
 * The HTTP cache is bypassed so a Studio edit is never hidden by a stale
 * intermediate. There is deliberately no If-None-Match / 304 path: the
 * response is only ~13KB, and Netlify rewrites response ETags with client
 * cache-validation suffixes, which made conditional matching unreliable — a
 * changed payload could be answered with "not modified" and the update
 * silently lost. Always fetching is both simpler and correct; the poller
 * compares content itself and skips re-rendering when nothing moved.
 *
 * Returns null on failure so the caller keeps showing what it already has.
